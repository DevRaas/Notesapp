# Notesapp
 Advanced Notes App is a web-based note-taking tool that enables users to create, edit, and categorize notes. It features Markdown support, dark mode, and text file export. Users can send notes to a Discord server via webhook, and the app automatically stores notes locally while allowing easy organization by tags for efficient management.
